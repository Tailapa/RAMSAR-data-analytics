Specialized micro-organisms such as anaerobes, cyanobacteria and phytoplankton survive in this harsh chemical environment. Outside the lake, there is considerable diversity of plant and animal life, as springs which help feed the lake provide a source of fresh water. Inhabiting the Site are 160 species of birds including the vulnerable Asian woollyneck (<em>Ciconia episcopus</em>) and common pochard (<em>Aythya ferina</em>), 46 species of reptiles, and 12 species of mammals including the iconic grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>).

The wetland forms an urban facility for treating the city's waste water and utilizing the treated water for pisciculture and agriculture, through the recovery of nutrients in an efficient manner - the water flows through fish ponds covering about 4,000 ha, and the ponds act as solar reactors and complete most of their bio-chemical reactions with the help of solar energy. Thus the system is described as ""one of the rare examples of environmental protection and development management where a complex ecological process has been adopted by the local farmers for mastering the resource recovery activities"" (RIS). The wetland provides about 150 tons of fresh vegetables daily, as well as some 10,500 tons of table fish per year, the latter providing livelihoods for about 50,000 people directly and as many again indirectly. The fish ponds are mostly operated by worker cooperatives, in some cases in legal associations and in others in cooperative groups whose tenurial rights are under legal challenge.

It is connected to the Bay of Bengal in the north via Uppukalli creek, and receives seawater during high tides or cyclones. As a result, the salinity of the wetland varies, with saltier water in the north transitioning to fresh water in the south at Kazhuveli basin. This variation allows the wetland to act as a migratory path and spawning ground for multiple fish species. The gum arabic tree (<em>Vachellia nilotica</em>) and Jerusalem thorn (<em>Parkinsonia aculeata</em>) found in the Site provide nesting areas for over 2,000 colonial nesting birds each breeding season, particularly for the spot-billed pelican (<em>Pelecanus philippensis</em>). Located along the central Asian flyway, the Site also provides feeding grounds for migratory species such as the vulnerable spotted eagle (<em>Aquila clanga</em>), imperial eagle (<em>Aquila heliaca</em>) and river tern (<em>Sterna aurantia</em>). Its swampy areas offer suitable nesting grounds for the vulnerable Indian flap-shelled turtle (<em>Lissemys punctata</em>) and Indian star tortoise (<em>Geochelone elegans</em>).
