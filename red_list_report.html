        <h1>Wetland Risk Assessment: The Red List</h1>
    </header>

    <p>We define the <strong>"Red List" of Indian Wetlands</strong> as those 
    high-value sites that achieve a <strong>Diversity Score of 5 or higher
    </strong> while simultaneously facing <strong>20 or more unique threats.
    </strong> These sites represent the most ecologically significant yet 
    vulnerable areas in the country. Based on the data, the following 
    sites are under extreme pressure:</p>

    <div class="red-list-grid">
        <div class="site-card">
            <div class="threat-badge">39 THREATS</div>
            <h3>Pallikaranai Marsh</h3>
            <p>This is the most stressed wetland in the current assessment. It is experiencing a total system assault, facing everything from urban sprawl and industrial pollution to sensory disturbances (light and noise) and severe climate events.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="site-card">
            <div class="threat-badge">35 THREATS</div>
            <h3>Gulf of Mannar</h3>
            <p>A complex marine ecosystem where heavy industrial activity, international shipping lanes, and climate change pressures converge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="site-card">
            <div class="threat-badge">34 THREATS</div>
            <h3>Nandur Madhameshwar</h3>
            <p>This site is suffering from severe fragmentation due to a high density of infrastructure, such as roads and utility lines, combined with relentless agricultural encroachment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="site-card">
            <div class="threat-badge">29 THREATS</div>
            <h3>Asan & Beas Reserves</h3>
            <p>These riverine systems are primarily stressed by hydrological disruptions, which include water regulation, dams, and canalization, compounded by heavy recreational and tourism use.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The analysis reveals that India's Ramsar sites are not merely facing 
    isolated environmental problems, but compound crises. Sites like the 
    Pallikaranai Marsh are navigating nearly 40 distinct threats simultaneously. 
    <strong>As a wetland falls within an urban or industrial sphere, the number
    of threats does not simply increase—it multiplies.</strong> This implies 
    that traditional conservation methods, which had narrow focus like protecting the
    water body itself, are insufficient. To preserve these ecological hubs, 
    management must shift towards integrated mitigation strategies to address
    the surrounding urban and industrial infrastructure as part of the broader
    ecosystem.</p>

        <p><hc><strong>Conclusion</strong></hc> </p>
            <p>The evaluation concludes that India’s 
        Ramsar policy has moved from slow, emblematic protection to rapid, 
        criteria‑rich expansion, but that the first four decades largely failed 
        to anticipate how urbanisation, infrastructure and climate pressures 
        would converge on the very wetlands of highest ecological value. 
        Going forward, the paper argues for a decisive shift from nominal 
        designation to risk‑aware governance: rebalancing Ramsar criteria 
        toward under‑represented ecosystem functions, de‑risking mega‑anchors, 
        protecting clusters and corridors, and using the Ramsar Red List as a 
        priority list for funding, enforcement, and Amrit Dharohar interventions
        so that India’s expanded network translates into durable ecological 
        security rather than a larger, more fragile inventory on paper.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This framework is designed as a data‑driven tool that can be updated 
        each year as new Ramsar sites are designated, criteria are revised, or 
        additional threats are reported, ensuring that India’s wetland policy 
        remains responsive to a changing ecological and institutional landscape.
